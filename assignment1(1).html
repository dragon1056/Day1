    <h1>
        b-tag
    </h1>
    <p>
        The b HTML element is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance. This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface. However, you should
        not use b for styling text; instead, you should use the CSS font-weight property to create boldface text, or the strong element to indicate that text is of special importance.
    </p>

    <h1> i-tag</h1>
    <p>The i HTML element represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms, taxonomical designations, among others. Historically, these have been presented using italicized type, which
        is the original source of the i naming of this element.

    </p>
    <h1> u tag</h1>
    <p>The p HTML element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related
        content, such as images or form fields.
    </p>
    <h1>select tag</h1>
    <p>The select HTML element represents a control that provides a menu of options.The above example shows typical select usage. It is given an id attribute to enable it to be associated with a label for accessibility purposes, as well as a name attribute
        to represent the name of the associated data point submitted to the server. Each menu option is defined by an option element nested inside the select tag.
    </p>
    <h1>button tag</h1>
    <p>The button HTML element is an interactive element activated by a user with a mouse, keyboard, finger, voice command, or other assistive technology. Once activated, it then performs a programmable action, such as submitting a form or opening a dialog.
        By default, HTML buttons are presented in a style resembling the platform the user agent runs on, but you can change buttons' appearance with CSS.
    </p>
    <h1>hr tag</h1>
    <p>The hr HTML element represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements: for example, a change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic within a section.
    </p>
    <h1>br tag</h1>
    <p>
        The br HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return). It is useful for writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is significant.
